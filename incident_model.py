"""Structured Incident identity, failure-scope classification, and
evidence-completeness accounting.

collector.build_incidents() already groups evidence around boot boundaries
and ranks explanatory hypotheses per incident (title/category/score/
confidence/supports/against/next_test) -- that ranking machinery is not
duplicated here and is not touched by this module. This module answers two
narrower questions cleanly, and keeps them separate:

  WHAT stopped responding, and how much of the system was affected?
    -> classify_failure_scope() / FAILURE_SCOPES

  WHY did it probably happen?
    -> collector.py's existing incident["hypotheses"], unchanged; this
       module only adds mechanism_tags(), a coarse normalisation of those
       existing hypotheses' categories for later fingerprinting, not a new
       ranking.

An earlier version of this module conflated the two into one
"classification" enum (e.g. gpu_drm_i915_incident, memory_thrashing,
plasmashell_panel_failure all as siblings), which meant a desktop freeze
caused by i915 could only ever be labelled as the GPU incident itself,
instead of "the desktop/compositor stopped responding (scope), most likely
because of the GPU/DRM path (mechanism, ranked, not certain)". That is what
FAILURE_SCOPES + mechanism_tags() replaces.

attach_incident_identity() adds a small number of keys to an existing
incident dict (incident_id, failure_scope, failure_scope_reasoning,
mechanism_tags, evidence_sources, evidence_completeness) without removing
or renaming any existing key, so every current consumer (report_schema,
the GUI, existing tests) is unaffected.
