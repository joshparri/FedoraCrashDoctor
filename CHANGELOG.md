# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Added `confidence_explanation.py`: turns collector.py's existing ranked hypotheses into the structured explanation shape a person actually needs, instead of a bare score -- supporting evidence and counter-evidence straight from the existing hypothesis (`supports`/`against`, unchanged), missing evidence derived directly from `incident_model`'s `evidence_completeness` states, the other competing hypotheses, a mechanism-specific "what would strengthen/weaken this" suggestion, and recurrence context when an `incident_fingerprint` family is supplied. `format_explanation_text()` renders the exact block shape from the mission brief (Likely mechanism / Confidence / Supports / Against / Missing / Competing hypotheses / Recurrence / Next useful evidence). This does not replace or re-run collector.py's scoring -- the ranking rules stay exactly where they are; this module only explains them. Verified end-to-end by chaining `collector.build_incidents()` -> `incident_fingerprint.build_families()` -> `confidence_explanation.explain_incident()` on a real i915 fixture and confirming the rendered text, not just isolated unit tests.
- Added `incident_fingerprint.py`: fingerprints an incident's recurring failure *pattern* -- built only from `incident_model`'s `failure_scope` and its top-2 `mechanism_tags`, never timestamps/PIDs/incident_id/boot_id -- so harmless per-occurrence variation never fragments one real recurring problem into separate families, while a materially different scope or mechanism correctly starts a new one. `build_families()` groups incidents and tracks first/last seen, occurrence count, and a confidence trend, keeping each family's `fam_`-prefixed fingerprint completely separate from the individual `inc_`-prefixed incident ids it groups. `frequency_trend()` reports increasing/decreasing/stable, but only with 4+ dated occurrences -- fewer than that honestly reports `insufficient_data` rather than a trend read from noise. `dormancy_note()` flags a family that's gone quiet far longer than its historical gap, always explicitly hedged ("does not confirm the underlying issue is resolved") -- tested directly to never say "fixed".
- Added `change_correlation.py`: bounded, non-causal correlation between an incident and recent system changes, reusing `collector.py`'s existing `rpm -qa --last` collection (no new collection task, and this never executes a package operation). Tracks the closest-to-the-incident change per package family (kernel, Mesa, KWin/Plasma/KScreen, linux-firmware, PipeWire/WirePlumber) within a bounded lookback window, reporting e.g. "kernel changed to 7.1.13-200.fc44 2.2 days before this incident. Temporal correlation only; causality is not established." -- verified against this machine's real package history, not just fixtures. A change after the incident, or too far before it to be useful context, is not reported. Kernel command-line changes were on the candidate list but there is no reliable historical record of past `/proc/cmdline` values to diff against; rather than fabricate that capability, `current_kernel_cmdline_context()` surfaces only the current boot's cmdline as informational context, with no change claimed.
- Added `incident_observations.py`: structured "what did you see?" evidence a person can attach to an incident by `incident_id` -- 13 optional yes/no/unknown questions (mouse/keyboard/TTY/audio/network/SSH/window updates/panel-only vs whole-desktop frozen/display black/spontaneous reboot/held power button/recovered on its own) plus free-text approximate time and activity-before fields, persisted per-incident (multiple observations can accumulate, never overwritten) as private (`0600`) JSON under `~/.local/state/fedora-crash-doctor/observations/`. `unknown` ("I don't know") is a distinct, real answer from `no`; every question can be left unanswered entirely (a fourth, implicit state). `refine_failure_scope_with_observations()` lets an observation sharpen an incident's `failure_scope` only when it is currently `unknown` and only when a positive "the system was still alive" signal was actually given (network/SSH/TTY reachable, or audio continuing) -- it never overrides a scope the logs already confirmed, and it never touches mechanism/hypotheses at all, since an observation is evidence, not proof. A new `--record-observation INCIDENT_ID` CLI flag runs a small terminal Q&A flow (not a GUI wizard) that saves directly via this module; GUI tab wiring is a disclosed follow-up, same as `symbolic_analysis.py`'s CLI-first precedent.
- Added `incident_model.py`: each incident `collector.build_incidents()` produces now gets a stable `incident_id` and a `failure_scope` answering "WHAT stopped responding, and how much of the system?" (application, plasmashell_panel, compositor_session, whole_system, clean_shutdown, or `unknown` when evidence doesn't establish a more specific scope) -- kept strictly separate from WHY it happened, which remains collector.py's existing ranked `hypotheses` (unchanged; `mechanism_tags()` only normalises their categories for later fingerprinting, it doesn't re-rank them). A graphics-adjacent unclean shutdown is therefore `failure_scope=whole_system` with a leading `gpu_drm` mechanism tag -- confirmed impact plus a ranked, non-certain explanation -- rather than one mixed "GPU incident" label that would overstate what the evidence actually shows. `incident_id` is derived only from the boot and the boundary event's own raw anchor timestamp (not the padded evidence window, not the failure_boundary label, not confidence or attached evidence), so it survives widening the window, reclassifying the boundary, or joining more evidence onto the same incident later -- regression-tested directly. `evidence_completeness` uses explicit states (`complete`/`unavailable`/`not_collected`/...) instead of a boolean, so "no canary/heartbeat/user-observation evidence exists yet" is never read as "checked and healthy". This is a first, tested increment of the structured Incident model; joining canary/heartbeat telemetry and user-reported observations, fingerprinting/recurrence across boots, and a wizard for capturing "what did you see?" are not yet implemented.
- Symbolic backtraces are no longer started automatically as a side effect of parsing crash history (which silently launched GDB, with debuginfod enabled, as a background thread). `symbolic_analysis.start_symbolic_analysis()` is now the only way to run one: an explicit, deduplicated, cancellable job with `queued/running/completed/failed/timed_out/truncated/cancelled/unavailable` states. Network access is itself opt-in and explicit: `allow_network` defaults to `False` (local debug info only, debuginfod explicitly disabled, any inherited `DEBUGINFOD_URLS` stripped), and only a caller passing `allow_network=True` -- from a UI action that has told the user debuginfod may contact the network -- gets network-assisted symbolication. `generate_backtrace()` gained real cancellation support and reports `network_used` in its result.
- Removed the hardcoded "antigravity" special case from application-crash classification. There is no longer any application-specific default in the source at all: an executable's minimum-incident-count threshold before it's reported can only be lowered via an optional, user/site-editable JSON config file (`app_crash_doctor.load_min_incident_overrides()`), never a built-in list.
- Fixed `install.sh` (missing `app_crash_doctor`, `symbolic_analysis`, `coredump_adapter`, `graphics_doctor`, `hardware_doctor`, `memory_oom`, `dadlan_doctor` -- a script-installed system was missing modules the GUI imports) and added `tests/test_install_manifest.py`, an automated installed-tree smoke test that derives every module reachable from the shipped entry points, stages exactly what `install.sh`/the RPM spec would install into an isolated directory, and proves the application imports cleanly from that tree alone -- a regression test for this exact bug class.
- Fixed version drift: README and `install.sh`'s completion message hardcoded "3.2.0" while `VERSION` and the RPM spec said 3.2.1; `install.sh` now reads `VERSION` at install time and the README no longer hardcodes a version. Added `tests/test_version_consistency.py` (checks current package metadata only; historical `CHANGELOG.md`/RPM `%changelog` entries are untouched and remain free to mention old versions).
- Fixed `packaging/fedora-crash-doctor.spec`'s placeholder `https://localhost.invalid/...` URL (also present in the PolicyKit policy vendor URL, and in the report JSON schema `$id`, now the canonical `raw.githubusercontent.com` content URL for that file).
- Fixed `uninstall.sh` and the RPM `%preun` scriptlet to also disable/remove the stability `.path`/`.service` units and the desktop-heartbeat service, which install.sh/`%post` enable but neither uninstall path previously cleaned up.
- Replaced `run_tests.sh`'s and `validate_release.sh`'s use of `unittest discover` (which never ran the newer pytest-style test files) with `pytest` as the one authoritative test runner.
- Rewrote `validate_release.sh` to report `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]`/`[SKIP]` (with a reason) for each individual check instead of two dead-end PolicyKit branches that both silently printed `[SKIPPED]`, and to also verify the `.path` unit (previously only `*.service` was checked). Validation never installs build dependencies itself. Also fixed an rpmlint `explicit-lib-dependency` error by depending on the actual binary path (`/usr/bin/notify-send`) instead of the `libnotify` package name.
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions CI running inside a real Fedora container (not Ubuntu) covering the Python suite, packaging manifest/version regressions, shell syntax/shellcheck, PolicyKit XML, desktop-file validation, systemd unit verification (including the `.path` unit), and an RPM build + rpmlint.
- Verified real systemd cores through the asynchronous analyser; enable debuginfod explicitly in batch mode, expose backtrace results, and use private user-state storage for unprivileged captures.
- Fixed background backtrace debugger arguments, absolute timeout, process cleanup, and 10 MiB output bound. Resource limits now run in a separate interpreter; private output creation rejects symlinks and records completion status.
- Derive the built RPM spec version from VERSION and include the application analysis runtime modules.

## 3.2.1 — 2026-08-27
- Fixed autoscan boot boundary to correctly inspect only the immediately preceding boot.
- Ensured dynamically generated storage (`storage_*`) and thermal (`thermal`) finding IDs contribute correctly to incident hypotheses.
- Updated GUI to correctly visualize nested PSI metrics from the canary schema.
- Made systemd-oomd audit compatible with flexible memory pressure configurations.
- Implemented structured journal source attribution (enforcing `_COMM` and `SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER` checks) to prevent unprivileged log-spoofing.
- Expanded automated regression suite (`tests/test_analysis.py`, `tests/test_autoscan.py`).

## 3.2.0 — 2026-08-27
- Hardened boot boundary logic to detect clean `systemd-shutdown` sequences and ignore historical crash artifacts.
- Implemented shutdown-context suppression window to ignore Wayland/Plasma teardown noise during clean reboots.
- Updated Wayland compositor regex to safely ignore `xkbcomp` and portal registration teardown errors.
- Removed dead `build_rpm` action from the privileged broker helper to reduce attack surface.

- Added `HISTORY.md` with the full Fedora/Linux crash and freeze master record,
  including diagnosis rankings, chronology, recovery procedure, and current
  improvement priorities.

- Added `TODO.md` with the release-hardening worklist and linked it from the
  README.
- Added a read-only host stability audit for live AVANCE-WS7 prevention checks.

- Split expensive RPM file verification into explicit `deep` scan mode so
  ordinary full scans stay more responsive.
- Added `validate_release.sh` for broad, CI-friendly best-effort validation.
- Added a repository desktop file for installer and packaging validation.
- Moved manual diagnostic experiments under `tools/manual/` so root-level
  unittest discovery no longer imports them as tests.
